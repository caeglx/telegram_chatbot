# telegram_chatbot
A telegram chatbot that sends you specific text messages. Based on the idea that the computer is done with a simulation and tells you the results.

**The code only includes the use of writing messages from the bot to you and not to the bot.**

The jupyter-notebook is for creating a chatbot and getting the token as well as the chat-id while the python-file includes a function for sending messages with the bot.
```python
send_message('6037895476:AAH-xMbGTC2wbZ6hsqQPTG24jxfWeba21E', 6069874721, 'Hello from your bot!')
```
> Hello from you bot!

Token and chat-id are not real and only for demostration purposes.
